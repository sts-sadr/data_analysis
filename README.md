# Data Analysis

## Data analysis exercises from the Data Analysis Discord Server

The sole purpose of the channel is to do data visualization on one dataset every week. The primary language will be SQL and Python. R might be brought in, in the near future (late May 2020). [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) will be used for the mjority of the practices.

Datasets will be posted every Monda, 4AM(GMT), all colab link submissions should be posted in the **#submission** channel. We are encouraged to review other peoples work and our submissions will be reviewed by the channel creator **@Kian**

## Packages Required

The packages that will be needed to learn are:

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

> **NOTE**: SQL will be required!

We will be using SQLite as the primary relational database management system. As a data analyst, SQL is your primary language, not Python, nor R. SQL will start to be used in week 5, so we need to start getting familiar with it.

Great tutorial can be found at [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp). We should go through everything on the list on the left. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) is also recommended to get a better understanding.
